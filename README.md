This site was my first project built entirely from scratch, outside of any coursework or tutorial. It serves as a central hub to showcase my work, provide an “about me,” and give visitors a way to contact me — a happy medium between raw GitHub repos and long-form blog content.

    React: Core framework for building the site

    React Router DOM: For client-side routing between pages

    React Responsive: Media queries for responsive layouts

    React Lottie: Animation library to load JSON animation data

    EmailJS: For serverless contact form email delivery

    HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Foundation and custom styling

<h2>🛠️ Features</h2>
